# devops-fun
A full-fledged DevOps repo containing scripts and tools related to latest automation and orchestration technologies.

## Goal 
> To maintain a repo with the knowledge and skills I've learned over the years and that someone else could learn from and put to good use.

Scripts and tools will be updated in this repo on a regular basis, related to Terraform, Ansible, Docker, Kubernetes and many more.

If you have anything you'd like to add or improve upon, please do reach out to me if you'd like to contribute.

Enjoy the tools and hope they'll be of good use to you. I'll strive to improve the scripts I have in place to ensure I'm following the best practices.
