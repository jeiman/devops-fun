# devops-fun
A full-fledged DevOps repo containing scripts and tools related to latest automation and orchestration technologies.

Goal: 
> To maintain a repo with the knowledge and skills I've learned and that someone else could learn from and put to good use.

Scripts and tools will be updated in this repo on a regular basis, related to Terraform, Ansible, Docker, Kubernetes and many more.

If you have anything you'd like to add, please do reach out to me if you'd like to contribute.

Enjoy the tools and hope they'll be of good use to you.
